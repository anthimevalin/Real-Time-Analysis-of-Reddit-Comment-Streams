So I was able to go off of cigarettes to just snus, then after I was just using snus I could start stepping down the nicotine level gradually. The whole thing took right about a year. I know it sounds really weird, but when you know exactly how much nicotine you're getting, it's easier to gradually decrease it.  The nicotine patches/gum/lozenges/etc.. were worthless to me since their amount of nicotine was so low compared two my 2-3 packs a day I was using.

JackXDark,kafvs2u,181nzn4,"All the comments you're getting about destroying them might solve your problem, so that's up to you.However - the *only* way that would be safe for you would be to get in touch with your local plod and ask them what to do. Say that they've come into your possession and you don't want them, but also don't want to answer any questions about them.It may well be illegal for you to destroy and dispose of the revolver, but it's probably not illegal in itself for you to *clean* it, and any ammunition you've ever touched.As far as the blades and knuckle dusters go, they're unlikely to want to examine them for potential use in crimes unless there's anything specific happened recently. But they'll be happy for them to be out of circulation.If you're *sure* the gun hasn't been used by yourself, or in any recent crime, then although the idea of handing it in at a registered gun shop is a decent one, the only *absolutely* safe thing to do is to leave it where it is (once cleaned), and tell the police that they can come and pick it up.They will *probably* agree to do this, and not insist on you giving a statement, ***however*** it will almost certainly be examined and go into an archive at the National Firearms Centre, in case its use in any crime is identified. If you could not possibly be connected with its potential past use, then the fact you gave it up voluntarily and without being prompted will count in your favour.The police are quite used to picking up firearms from people who have held them legitimately but become too old or ill to continue holding on to them, as well as, for example, people that have had a firearms certificate revoked because they've got into some other sort of trouble, or are on medication that might make keeping them unwise. They will *probably* want some details from you, but you *can* say that they came into your possession unexpectedly and it might put you at risk to disclose any other details. Which is quite possibly the truth. It's your call, but this is 'the right thing to do' in this circumstance and might carry less risk than disposing of them yourself, which could be seen as incriminating.Fact is, you've done something dodgy in having them and broken the law, and there's no getting away from that.

BeefyBob_likes_beef,kafw6nq,181zbm7,"I don't think they are dumb (in the sense of actually being dumb). I think you have to understand how they work and the safeguards they employ to stop thieves.The first thing we have to understand is tolerance. You put your bag on and it takes the weight. If the bags over a certain weight beep beep computer says no. Then we have the programmed weight of what something should be so the next is bag + weight of item plus weight of next item. Now if we think about for example tins, they won't all be identical weight. Those beans might more a bit more sauce than beans and so on. The scales in the factory for other goods might have been a little off so now they not the expected weight. If the tolerance to this expected weight is set too low it's beep beep computer says no.The other is what I call the Indiana Jones check. You know when you have to adjust your bag a little and it's (that's right) beep beep computer says no it's to stop you swapping that tin of beans for a 40 inch 4k TV. I jest ofc but if you weighed something that was the same weight as a chunk of meat you could just swap it and leave one the side.That's why they act the way they do. I would imagine in stores with little theft these tolerances are a lot higher with less issues for customers.The added bonus of all that is that every time that till goes beep beep computer says no a person is checking you out though I know these days they don't even bother to look. They did that at the beginning but not anymore which defeats the purpose of this measure.Also, if they have people checking receipts just walk past them and apologise. I've just done the supermarkets job for them and I'm not getting inconvenienced for it.",AskUK,2023-11-23T14:24:49,2023-11-23T14:25:00.983402

3_Stokesy,kafyghp,w609si,"Both of these factors play a role I would say. However, one interesting thing I noticed thinking about this question that never occured to me is how this isn't really the case in Scotland. I think the main reason for that is simply because we have more coastline for our size due to the more curving nature of the land, as well as more mountains, so there are simply more coastal settlements. Its more likely that major cities for example will be on the coast, in fact, of the 8 cities in Scotland, 5 are coastal (Edinburgh, Dunfirmline, Aberdeen, Dundee and Inverness) and 3 aren't (Glasgow, Perth and Stirling.)  So therefore, I think part of the thing with England is that the major cities, where all the wealth is, are more inland, think London, Birmingham, Manchester, etc. If a major city is coastal, its on an estuary, like Liverpool, Bristol and Hull. Therefore coastal towns don't generally tend to have wealth and tend to be dependent on more fickle industries.",AskUK,2023-11-23T14:42:26,2023-11-23T14:42:38.586339

connorh193,kag0ovf,1820u7i,"Bad food. Yeah, our food doesn't look fancy . it has a rustic look to it, and there's a lot of earthy-brown colouration. But that doesn't mean it's unseasoned. I love cooking traditionally British dishes like Shepherd's/Cottage pie (mince (lamb/beef), carrots, peas, onions, leeks, herbs (thyme, rosemary), Worcestershire sauce, and a little bit of red wine, salt, black pepper with a grating of sharp cheddar on the top of the mashed potato (cream, butter, potato (sometimes a mix of sweet potato aswell)). I would hardly say that is lacking seasoning.I think it does irk me a little more when some proponents of ""British food"" state how diverse we are in terms of cuisine as a defence. While I agree that having access to a wide variety of different cuisines is a big plus and something to be proud of, that's not really a defence of British food itself.We do very well with rustic foods like pies (pork pies, steak and ale, steak and kidney, even star gazey pie is delicious once you get past the fish heads staring at you haha), stews, roasts, etc and a hilarious naming sense that doesn't do the dishes any favours (I'm looking at you toad in the hole and bacon badger) but are still delicious.Then there's our desserts, which we also do really well: bread and butter pudding, sticky toffee pudding, fool, Eton mess, knickerbocker glory, flies' cemetery (yes there is indeed a delicious dessert called this), and many more.Rant over.

daninafryingpan,kag0uo5,181zbm7,I used to be really good at weighing my empty bag first and then bagging as I scan. But then one day all of a sudden the Tesco self service tills decided that my Tesco bag for life was too heavy to be a bag so would fire up an error every time I tried to weigh it empty first. So now I just scan and bag after. Another thing I noticed they have recently updated (thankfully) in Tesco is they removed the need to insert a physical coupon into the machine after it‚Äôs been scanned. I always scan my coupons from the app and then the machine just sits there waiting for you to insert your non-existent piece of paper. I did find out though that you can insert a piece of paper partially and pull it back out again to clear this message - this is what the staff have done every time I ask them for help but I feel like a criminal doing it myself.,AskUK,2023-11-23T15:00:10,2023-11-23T15:00:23.802453

bumblebeesanddaisies,kag3z0a,1821cot,I think the reason it is suggested not to use it on towels is that the conditioner does stay on the fabric as it goes in at the end of the wash and that can coat the towels and stop them from being as absorbent. But it doesn't damage them. Same as using hair conditioner doesn't damage your hair. It can clog up your washing machine a bit though when you use it but as long as you are doing hot washes and cleaning out the draw and filter regularly it should be fine :) I always use fabric conditioner and I can tell the difference if I happen to have run out.

People try to compare a $300 PC laptop to a MBP and they aren't the same animal even during the Intel silicon years. Perhaps the biggest thing wrong with this argument is the lack of understanding how component sourcing works. I worked at a Corning plant where we pressed CRTs for every major manufacturer - if someone bought a CRT TV in the 90s (and into the 00s) in North America the glass probably came from ours or our sister plant. Who's per piece price was the most expensive? Sony. Even though the components, mix, and process were the same Sony paid more per piece (which translates to more for the consumer). Why? Because their spec tolerances were the tightest. Tighter tolerances equals more wastage which equals higher per piece pricing. Tighter spec tolerances is less margin for component failure down the road, especially when it comes to electronic components.Apple has been accused of being overpriced - which isn't completely untrue even after figuring in the QA controls side, but only those with no real experience claim Apple makes terrible products and provides terrible service.",AskAnAmerican,2023-11-23T15:30:42,2023-11-23T15:30:52.792347

FreshPossession,kag9z6t,181z655,"People used to live in digs, but that was in the 1950s and 1960s (so, more than 50 years ago). Since then there has been a push for more independence in housing - we're unusual in Europe because of the amount of people who buy their own homes, and who do not live with extended family.The Local Housing Allowance (which forced people under 35 who claim housing benefit to live in shared accommodation) was introduced in 2008 - that's a pretty recent change that drove an increase in people living in shared accommodation.HMOs do have a long history (see my previous mention of digs) but clear definitions and mandatory licencing of large HMOs was introduced in 2004 which is again pretty recent.It's always been common for students and people first leaving home to share. The unusual feature about today is that it's the only viable option, long term, for many older people. It's very common to find well paid professionals in their 30s in house shares, and that's something that wasn't happening 40 years ago (apart from London, but London is almost never comparable to the rest of the UK).",AskUK,2023-11-23T16:03:57,2023-11-23T16:04:08.446381

Well fed kids are way less disruptive in a class. It benefits the whole class and the teachers.  We pay our teachers well.   It's pretty easy to make 100K as a teacher.

They were about to clock off after dealing with this guy, so they weren't putting up with his crap. I called the police after he refused to leave due to noise complaints. He then told the police that he wasn't leaving until he got a refund. He wasn't getting one as he was evicted, so the police gave him the option of leaving of his own accord, or having cuffs placed on him, and him and his belongings dragged out onto the street. He initially refused still, and only changed his mind when the officer reached for their cuffs and walked towards him.I have no idea why he was trying for a refund when it was his company that paid for the room, and since he got his manager involved in the whole thing at 6am, he ended up losing his job. He was in town to complete his manager training at a new branch. Had he just kept the noise down when he came back to the hotel, there wouldn't have been a problem. When I knocked on the door to evict him, the other guy he was with was in the shower and they were shouting to each other through the closed bathroom door.

Whyysoseriousss,kags27z,1825cwp,"Horrible spending habits caused it, I won't say I've enjoyed the last 4 months but I feel much better for it! What I realised was; seeing a minus before my balance made me feel rough, and to top it off, having to pay interest for the privilege for spending the banks money. I honestly felt so crap every payday I'd be +¬£100 or so but that only lasted a few days until I was back into a minus. I changed where I shop, this one wasn't easy for me. I'll admit I've been a food snob for years, but to get a full trolley of shopping from lidl for under ¬£100 vs a full trolley at tesco for ¬£140+/-. Not buying lunch out and about, the first month I went a little too far maybe? I cooked a batch of pasta at the start of the week then I would add either tuna mayo or bacon with it. I quickly got bored of the pasta after that month but I knew I had to get used to preparing lunches. A weird unassuming one, maybe? Drink more tap water! It's the cheapest source of a drink. Fizzy drinks, etc, cost a fortune added up. Throw in some squash if you really struggle. Stopping impulse buying too,  gave myself a weekly budget for things. I haven't brought anything other than food shopping and fuel. No treats, no takeaways etc. But now I don't have an extra ¬£50 a month to pay out to my bank so there is a saving aspect of doing this too. When I got to the end of the first month, I was ¬£-1600 +/- before payday. I knew I could save ¬£400 a month. Once that first month was out the way, it was a challenge to do it over and over again. Will I stop doing this now I'm out my overdraft? Sort of, I'm cutting it back to ¬£200 a month to save, giving myself a bit of breathing space No windfall unfortunately for me, just seeing that balance dragged me down so badly and no doubt done some serious damage to my credit file too.
